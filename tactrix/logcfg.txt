;-------------triggers---------------
;
; note that parameters must be previously defined 
; before defining triggers using them
;
; triggers allow you to control when logging starts and stops
; this example sets up triggers such that logging only occurs
; when the engine is running (RPM > 0)
;
; triggers consist of a condition (a RPN expression using comparison operators)
; and an action. the RPN comparison operators match those in the C language:
;
; > < >= <= == != && ||
;
; if the condition evaluates to a non-zero value, that action is taken
;
; at present the following actions are available:
;
; start - starts logging to a file (if not already doing so)
; stop - stops logging to a file
; newfile - starts a new file (only if already logging to a file)
;
; IMPORTANT - if you have no triggers defined, logging will start automatically.
; if you have *any* triggers defined, logging will not start until a start action
; occurs

conditionrpn = Engine_Speed,0,>	
action = start

conditionrpn = Engine_Speed,0,==
action = stop

; here is a second triggering example using the rear defogger switch
; uncomment it and comment out the sample above to use it

;conditionrpn = defogger_sw,1,==
;action = start

;conditionrpn = defogger_sw,0,==
;action = stop


; here is an example of using both previous values in a trigger and using
; the newfile action.
; this example starts a new logging file (logging must have already been started)
; whenever the throttle increases from below 95% to above 95%
; #throttle refers to the previous throttle sample

; be careful with the conditions under which you create newfiles, or you may accidentally
; create thousands of files!
